# Getting started with Firemyna

Depending on the framework or bundler of your choice, please start with one of those guides, and then continue to the [Develop] section for the next steps:

- [Astro]
- [Next.js]
- [Remix]
- [Vite]
- [Create React App]

If you can't find integration with the tooling you’re looking for, you can refer to the [Vanilla] guide and/or ask for it in the [GitHub Issues].
